  summary: "Blindness is one of José Saramago’s most influential and disturbing novels, examining how fragile civilization becomes when social norms suddenly disappear. The story opens with a man who inexplicably loses his sight while driving, seeing only a milky white brightness instead of darkness. This condition spreads rapidly, turning into a mass epidemic that overwhelms the city. In response, the government hastily quarantines the blind in an abandoned mental asylum, believing isolation will contain the crisis. Instead, the space becomes a brutal experiment in human behavior.\n\nInside the asylum, fear, hunger, and the absence of authority lead to moral collapse. Power is seized by the strongest, cruelty becomes routine, and survival outweighs compassion. A small group of characters stands at the heart of the narrative, led by the doctor’s wife—the only person who retains her sight. Through her perspective, the reader witnesses the degradation of human dignity and the emotional cost of witnessing suffering while remaining unseen.\n\nThe novel’s importance lies in its universal message. Blindness is not simply about the loss of vision, but about ethical blindness: the inability or refusal to see others as human beings. Saramago exposes how quickly societies abandon values such as empathy, justice, and responsibility when confronted with fear. The book serves as a warning about the dangers of authoritarian responses, social indifference, and moral passivity.\n\nStylistically, Blindness reflects Saramago’s unique literary voice. He uses long sentences, sparse punctuation, and unnamed characters, creating a flowing, almost hypnotic narrative. Dialogue is embedded within paragraphs, forcing readers to engage closely with the text. This unconventional style intensifies the sense of confusion and mirrors the chaos experienced by the characters, making Blindness a deeply immersive and unforgettable reading experience.",
