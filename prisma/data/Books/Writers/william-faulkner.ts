  summary: "The Sound and the Fury is one of William Faulkner’s most challenging and influential novels, widely regarded as a cornerstone of literary modernism. The book tells the story of the Compson family, a once-aristocratic Southern household in decline, and traces their moral, emotional, and social collapse over several decades. Rather than following a linear narrative, the novel is divided into four distinct sections, each presenting a different perspective on the family’s disintegration.\n\nThe first section is narrated by Benjy, a man with an intellectual disability, whose perception of time is fragmented and non-linear. His memories move freely between past and present, reflecting emotional associations rather than chronological order. The second section follows Quentin, a Harvard student obsessed with honor, purity, and the loss of his family’s former greatness. His internal monologue reveals deep psychological turmoil and culminates in tragedy. The third section, narrated by Jason, offers a bitter, cynical voice driven by resentment, greed, and cruelty. The final section shifts to a third-person perspective, focusing on Dilsey, the family’s Black servant, whose endurance and moral clarity stand in stark contrast to the Compsons’ decay.\n\nThe importance of The Sound and the Fury lies in its radical narrative experimentation and psychological depth. Faulkner revolutionized the novel by using stream-of-consciousness techniques to portray subjective experience, memory, and inner conflict. The book explores themes of time, loss, family, race, and the collapse of Southern values in the aftermath of the Civil War.\n\nStylistically, the novel is demanding but richly rewarding. Faulkner’s shifting narrators, fragmented structure, and intense interior monologues require active engagement from the reader. This bold style captures the chaos of human consciousness and cements the novel’s status as a landmark in twentieth-century literature.",
